- Inside out → Functional
- Outside in → Using market signals from the channels:
	- Changing demand to reduce demand latency
	- Suppliers, looking at issues around pattern recognition with supply irregularities
	- Messages from logistics
	- Delay visibility
- AI can create/look at deeper insights
	- Sense, respond, and drive proactive response
	- Pattern recognition
		- Channel data
		- Supplier data
- Hard to make improvements when the model is wrong
- Data is growing exponentially
	- Traditional architectures are unable to make the most of the data
		- Antiquated techniques i.e. rows/columns
		- Need to embrace unstructured data., streaming data, image data
- 9% of companies actively design their supply chain
	- Form and function of inventory
	- Postponement strategies
	- Push/Pull decoupling points
- Between the Design Layer and Traditional Planning layer needs to be a Unified Data model
	- Translates design into the optimisation engines
- Average company has at least 12 planning systems
	- Not synchronised
	- Optimisation engine models are not aligned
		- i.e. Promotion Management, Price Management, and Consumer Products have nothing to do with a data model level, traditional demand planning or CRM to demand planning
	- AI can synchronise and align
		- Using supply chain master data
		- Transactional data
- Synchronise planning engines
	- Promotional
	- Planning
	- Manufacturing
	- etc.
- Inventory Turns
- Asset Utilisation
- Map strategy to flows
- Signals that are available but aren't used
	- transportation
	- IoT
	- GPS Data
	- Map Data
	- Weather Charts
	- Public Sentiment
	- Use these to better solve problems; improve the balance sheet
		- Minimise exceptions
		- Improve Reliability
	- Make use of all data
		- 80% of the surrounding data is not used

- Simulate human intelligence
- Narrow AI/ML models to more generic AI systems
- Nodes and Links of the supply chain: Value Adding
	- Warehouses
	- Stores
	- Fulfilment centres
	- Ports
	- Planes
	- Trucks
	- Vehicles
	- Drones
	- Operators
	- Associates
- AI can alleviate everyday concerns allowing operators etc. to focus more complex supply chain trade-offs
- Smart assistants that can help workers figure out complex tasks
	- Advice
	- Training
	- Make it easier to transfer knowledge
- Areas AI can help in
	- **Demand Forecasting**
		- Current issues
			- Uncertainty
			- Missed forecasts
			- Inefficiencies
			- Rebalancing due to wrong forecasts
		- AI can assist in bettering demand forecasting by developing narrower predictions
			- Process large amounts of current and historical data to create smart forecasts
			- Understand connections better than humans
			- Deal with more data than is humanly possible is a timely manner
			- Detect problems faster
			- Plan around holidays (is it on a Monday or Friday), weather patterns
	- **Inventory Management**
		- Once the Forecast is created, decisions need to be made about flow
			- Where is the inventory?
			- How do you move it?
			- How do you make trade-offs with limited capacity?
			- How do you position it?
		- AI could
			- Predict safety stocks
			- Optimised trucks
				- Routing
				- Capacity
				- Order sizes
			- Make recommendations
		- Too many possibilities for humans to consider when planning inventory; 
			- Millions of options for monitoring, tracking, improving
				- Risks present in items, stores, import centres; High or Low risk?
			- AI can process and estimate millions of options quickly
		- Geographical and Time differences
		- Unify inventory planners across the organisation
			- Allow them to focus on things like customer experience
		- Auditing and Risk management can be handled by AI
	- **Supplier Management**
		- Currently
			- Observing their performance
			- Finding opportunities for joint value
			- Changing the way products are received/designed
			- New product development cycles
		- Relationships between suppliers and their clients (i.e. us) is ambiguous
		- Ai could
			- Help identify disruptions
		- Area of opportunity for AI, but difficult to incorporate it into supplier management
	- **Customer Experience**
		- AI is currently used extensively
- Keys for a successful AI implementation
	- People first
		- Humans remain the centre of the business
	- AI needs to understand the values of the organisation
		- Treat them as new employee
	- AI ethics
		- Ensure they remain on the correct path
	- Transparency
		- Not about revealing trade secrets, engine etc.
		- Stakeholders i.e. clients, customers should be informed about how the AI is utilised
			- Allow them to provide feedback which the AI can use to improve
	- Not a deploy and leave solution
		- Should be monitored continuously
			- Ensure there are no biases
		- Should be able to be inspected and audited regularly
- Clear objective, Right Security, Risk Assessments, Contingency Planning
- People, ethics, transparency, continuous monitoring
- Common Pitfalls when implementing AI
	- Don't treat Ai as if it knows everything
	- Don't think you know everything about the AI
	- AI systems are very complex to implement
	- Be humble, experiment, don't get carried away
	- Bring in people who know what they are doing
	- Start "simple" to ensure the system is performing as the business and customers expect
- Simple tasks will be automated; Complex tasks will be augmented by AI
	- Enhance and augment tasks, not replace them
- Human skills and AI
	- AI can provide clarity of data to enhance human decision making
	- Improve meeting efficiency
	- Unify the business
		- Same language and decisions
	- Need to be able to mentor the AI
	- Allows people to focus on more demanding and complex tasks
