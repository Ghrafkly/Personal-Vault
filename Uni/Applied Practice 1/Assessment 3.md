- Areas AI can help in
	- **Demand Forecasting**
		- Current issues
			- Uncertainty
			- Missed forecasts
			- Inefficiencies
			- Rebalancing due to wrong forecasts
		- AI can assist in bettering demand forecasting by developing narrower predictions
			- Process large amounts of current and historical data to create smart forecasts
			- Understand connections better than humans
			- Deal with more data than is humanly possible is a timely manner
			- Detect problems faster
			- Plan around holidays (is it on a Monday or Friday), weather patterns
	- **Inventory Management**
		- Once the Forecast is created, decisions need to be made about flow
			- Where is the inventory?
			- How do you move it?
			- How do you make trade-offs with limited capacity?
			- How do you position it?
		- AI could
			- Predict safety stocks
			- Optimised trucks
				- Routing
				- Capacity
				- Order sizes
			- Make recommendations
		- Too many possibilities for humans to consider when planning inventory; 
			- Millions of options for monitoring, tracking, improving
				- Risks present in items, stores, import centres; High or Low risk?
			- AI can process and estimate millions of options quickly
		- Geographical and Time differences
		- Unify inventory planners across the organisation
			- Allow them to focus on things like customer experience
		- Auditing and Risk management can be handled by AI
	- **Supplier Management**
		- Currently
			- Observing their performance
			- Finding opportunities for joint value
			- Changing the way products are received/designed
			- New product development cycles
