## Test Suite
1. Define your requirements - these come from the requirements as stated in the assessment description. I considered these as functional requirements. You may also have non-functional requirements or nice-to-haves
2. Define your test cases, if you can tie them to the requirements defined earlier, it will be a win for you
3. Table format is the way to go for your test cases. Your format looks good. I add Precondition and expected Postcondition, as well as a Test name in addition to the Test ID
4. Test Strategies - I took these from the recommended readings. One in particular (Strong Robust Equivalence Testing) is a good one to consider if you haven't already.

## Functional Testing

## Equivalence Class Testing


## Decision Table Testing
